# logicmonitor_device_group

Provides a LogicMonitor device group resource. This can be used to create and manage LogicMonitor device groups.

## Example Usage
```hcl
# Create a LogicMonitor device group
resource "logicmonitor_device_group" "my_device_group" {
  applies_to = "isLinux()"
  custom_properties = [
		{
			name = "addr"
      		value = "127.0.0.1"
		},
		{
			name = "host"
      		value = "localhost"
		}
	]
  default_collector_id = 1
  description = "Linux Servers"
  disable_alerting = true
  enable_netflow = true
  group_type = "Normal"
  name = "Linux Servers"
  parent_id = 1
}
```
## Example Usage - AWS Cloud Account
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  // add your AWS credentials
  access_key = ""
  secret_key = ""
  region     = ""
}

// used for verifying LM access to your AWS account
data "logicmonitor_data_resource_aws_external_id" "my_external_id" {
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role" {
  statement {
    actions = [
      "sts:AssumeRole"
    ]
    condition {
      test = "StringEquals"
      values = [
        data.logicmonitor_data_resource_aws_external_id.my_external_id.external_id
      ]
      variable = "sts:ExternalId"
    }
    effect = "Allow"
    principals {
      identifiers = [
        "282028653949"

  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSSupportAccess"
  role       = aws_iam_role.lm.name
}

// this resource acts as a timing buffer between the update of the AWS resources
// and the creation of the AWS Device Group in LM. This is required because the
// AWS API takes some time before the changes to the role is reflected. If done
// to quickly, the LM operation will fail.
resource "null_resource" "wait" {
  triggers = {
    always_run = timestamp()
  }
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "sleep 10s"
  }
  // runs after all dependent AWS operations are complete
  depends_on = [
	  aws_iam_role.lm,
	  aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.read_only_access,
	  aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.aws_support_access,

					value = "HighPriority"
				}
			]
		}
		services {

	parent_id = 1
	// Must guarantee that the AWS resources are updated before creating the device group
	depends_on = [

    + `useDefault` - Whether or not to use the default settings for this service. When set to true in a Service's settings, all other fields will be ignored (required)
  + `devices` - Cloud devices to monitor in the group (computed)
    + `deviceType` - Cloud device type (2 for AWS Device) (int)
    + `requiredProps` - Required device properties (array of strings)
  + `services` - Cloud account services to monitor. This is an object with keys for each AWS service that have the same arguments as `default`. See example above (all service keys alternate letters and underscores, but not numbers; SQS=s_q_s, SAGEMAKER=s_a_g_e_m_a_k_e_r, EC2=e_c2 etc.)

## Import

device groups can be imported using their device group ID or full path
```
$ terraform import logicmonitor_device_group.my_device_group 66
